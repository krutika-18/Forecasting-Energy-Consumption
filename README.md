# Energy Consumption Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project aims to forecast hourly and daily energy consumption using historical data from the PJM Interconnection power grid. By leveraging time series analysis and machine learning techniques, the model predicts future energy usage patterns to assist in better energy management and planning.

## Objective
- Analyze historical hourly energy consumption data.
- Capture trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the data.
- Build a forecasting model to predict future energy consumption for the next 30 days.
- Provide insights to optimize energy distribution and reduce costs.

## Dataset
- PJM Interconnection hourly power consumption data (in megawatts).
- Includes timestamped energy usage records over multiple years.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and seasonality
- Feature engineering for time series components (e.g., hour of day, day of week, holidays)
- Model building using time series forecasting methods (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet)
- Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and MAE

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- statsmodels, fbprophet (or Prophet)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
